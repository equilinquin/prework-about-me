        <h2>Artist Bio</h2>

        <p>Alecia Beth Moore, or professionally known as P!nk, is an American singer and songwriter.  Her career first started in a girl group called Choice in 1995, then later signed on with LaFace Records to start her solo career. P!nk's debut was R&B-influenced before moving her music toward Pop Rock.  She was known once as a "wild child" or a "rebel" in the entertainment industry, but has always been known as one of the "most trailblazing artist" of her pop generation.  Her biggest musical influences are Madonna and Janis Joplin.
            Aside from her music career, P!nk is an advocate for many chareties, is an animal-rights activist, and supports the LGBTQ community. </p>
