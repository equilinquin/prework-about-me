      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hey all, I'm a jack of all trades and love to learn different things.  I've learned from different industries: Hospitlality, Retail, Customer Services, Outreach, and Culinary.  I love learning new things and right now I'm learning code to maybe become a web developer. Currently, I'm a supervisor/cook at Whole Foods Market.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm originally from Hawai'i on an island called Lana'i.  You probably have to look it up to know where it is :).</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>My favorite hobbies are: solving puzzles like sudoku, karuko, etc; reading, coloring, chrocheting, occasional painting (although I'm not that good at it).</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job would include a challenging environment that helps people come together to solve issues or to have fun.  I love an environment that thrives on possitive energy.  I don't have a particular job in mind, but if it's able to meet this type of criteria then I'd be happy.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in the Portland Metro area of the great state of Oregon</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I love learning new things.  I've done coding for astronomy classes once before and never pursued it after.  I love that this industry is always changing and creating up and coming new technology and I hope to become part of that culture.</p>
